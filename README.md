# module-app_integration
Example module for js app integration into a Drupal 7 site.

The standalone.html file shows the example data visualization as a standalone page.

This module demonstrates how to take the D3 based visualiation in the standalone.html file and insert it into Drupal as content: two Drupal blocks and a fully rendered page as a Drupal node.

Environment Notes:

* Drupal 7
* The site is running jquery v1.7
* ( link to site master theme )
* The data visualization we're rendering uses D3 and Google webfonts
