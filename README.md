# module-app_integration
Example module for js app integration into a Drupal 7 site.

The standalone.html file shows the example data visualization as a standalone page.

This module demonstrates how to take a simple D3 based data visualization (as seen in standalone.html) and insert it programmaticaly into Drupal as content. It creates two Drupal blocks and a fully rendered page (a Drupal node).

Environment Notes:

* Drupal 7
* The site is running jquery v1.7
* ( link to site master theme )
* The data visualization we're rendering uses D3 and Google webfonts
